# 📋 Analytical Report: Strategic Customer Retention

## 1. Executive Summary
The telecommunications sector faces high customer acquisition costs. This analysis aimed to identify the primary drivers of customer churn using historical data. Our findings indicate that *contract duration* and *lack of tech support* are the strongest predictors of churn. The implemented dashboard allows stakeholders to monitor these metrics in real-time.

## 2. Problem Statement
The company is experiencing an undefined rate of customer attrition. The objective was to predict which customers are at risk and understand the correlation between service features (e.g., Fiber Optic, Streaming TV) and cancellation rates.

## 3. Data Analysis & Findings

### A. The "Month-to-Month" Trap
Data analysis revealed a strong correlation between Contract type and Churn.
* *Observation:* Month-to-month customers account for the vast majority of churned users.
* *Business Implication:* Long-term contracts successfully lock in customers, reducing the "easy exit" behavior.

### B. The Fiber Optic Anomaly
While Fiber Optic service generates higher MonthlyCharges, it also sees a higher churn rate compared to DSL.
* *Hypothesis:* This suggests a potential issue with price-to-value perception or technical reliability of the Fiber infrastructure.

### C. The Role of Support
Customers who do not subscribe to TechSupport or OnlineSecurity are almost *2x more likely to churn*.
* *Insight:* Value-added services act as "sticky" features that increase switching costs for customers.

## 4. Proposed Recommendations

Based on the data, the following actions are recommended to reduce churn:

1.  *Migrate to Annual Contracts:* Launch a targeted marketing campaign offering a 5-10% discount for month-to-month users who switch to a 1-year contract.
2.  *Bundle Support Services:* Make TechSupport a standard inclusion in the Fiber Optic package rather than an optional add-on to increase product stickiness.
3.  *Onboarding Focus:* Since churn peaks at low tenure (0-6 months), implement a "New Customer Success" program to hand-hold users during the first half-year.

## 5. Conclusion
By shifting focus from acquisition to retention—specifically targeting month-to-month Fiber users—the company can significantly improve Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). The accompanying Power BI dashboard serves as a monitoring tool to track the success of these interventions.
